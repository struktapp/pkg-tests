## Package Development

This package will require installation into your `app/src/{{AppName}}` folder.
The `publish:package` command takes argument `package` if you inicate key `package` in 
your `cfg/repo.php` file for value `Strukt\Package\PkgTests::class`. Since your source 
will be in the root folder in a subfolder called `package` it will allow the publisher 
to install files in the your app source folder `app/src`.

```sh
./xcli publish:package package
```
Have a good one!
